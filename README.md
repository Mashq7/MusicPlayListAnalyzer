# MusicPlayListAnalyzer

The project is a Python project that analyzes a music playlist and provides insights about its contents. 
The project was developed as part of a Python training program, with the goal of improving code readability and organization.

The project reads a txt file containing information about songs in a playlist, such as title, artist, genre, duration, and year. 
It then performs various analyses on the data, including:

Computing the total duration of the playlist
Identifying the most frequently occurring artist in the playlist
The analyses are implemented as separate functions, each taking the playlist data as input and returning the results. 
The main script coordinates the reading of the data file and the calling of the analysis functions. The results are displayed on the console.

The code is written in a modular and organized way, with clear and meaningful function and variable names, comments, and docstrings. 
It follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.

Overall, MusicPlayListAnalyzer demonstrates how to write clean, maintainable, and reusable Python code for data analysis tasks.
